##Summary:
This is a property finder application using api nestoria, this api seems not to be available in the U.S. <br>
My plans are to launch in Mexico first then launch in different countries like England and Brazil. <br>
Then if the app is successful enough we can rewrite it to make it work with an api that works in the U.S. <br>


##Commits: 
  Init Files: The files are fundemental for the project to run <br>
  Sam.2: Would be an update that implements a tab bar in the application <br>
