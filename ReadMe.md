##Summary:
This is a property finder application using api nestoria, this api seems not to be available in the U.S. <br>
My plans are to launch in Mexico first then launch in different countries like England and Brazil. <br>
Then if the app is successful enough we can rewrite it to make it work with an api that works in the U.S. <br>

##Install: 
1. Clone Repo
2. install npm <i> you have to be in the path of the project you cloned to</i>
3. react-native run-ios <i> assuming your runing in mac and xcode is installed </i>
