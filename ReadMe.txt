This is a property finder application using api nestoria, this api seems not to be available in the U.S. 
My plans are to launch in Mexico first then launch in different countries like England and Brazil.
Then if the app is successful enough we can rewrite it to make it work with an api that works in the U.S. 


#Commits: 
  Init Files: The files are fundemental for the project to run
  Sam.2: Would be an update that implements a tab bar in the application
  

Comments: 
 File name, created by, change history github already does this.
 Comments concerning specific function etc in the code should commented. 
 -Standard to adding comments:

      line

  Comment format example:
